# IntoSpace
This Project is about creating a complex space-themed game.
Main subject in the game is to develop a working social and political system ruled by players and an economic system as the key to achieve ones goals.
The player should be able to create new structures like spacecrafts or stations and new technology.
The core aspect of development is to provide this function to the player. This is done by giving the oportunity to generate new materials and forms with basic behavior.
In the end, the player should be able to create a material just fitting his purpose and form it into whatever it shall become. For example you should be able craft a strong armor from compounds and forge it around your ship.
Another crucial point of development is the creation of physical calculation. All movements are ment to be mathematical and are thus calculateable. If a bullet hits you in a weak spot, your systems may take lethal damage. There shall be no thing as healthbars, just the direct impact on the hull. If your Oxygen-Supply-System gets pierced, you may loose air and die to suffocation.
One last aspect is providing IT support. This plays an important role in both fighting and flying. The player is able to program his own ship to control gun fire and thrusters in an automaic way. This way you decide how to track enemies or hold steady.

Keep you up to date!
